# Determining-Sample-Size for a tracer study. 
The following parameters are required to calculate City-level sample size for Urban Destitute Children Rehabilitation Tracer Study
The confidence level: How confident do we need to be to ensure the results didn’t occur by chance? Detecting it with higher confidence requires more sample. Typical choices include 95% confidence (alpha=0.05) or 99% confidence (alpha=0.01). In our calculation we will include both 95% and 99%, although we may have to go with the 95% confidence level due to financial constraints. The confidence level is 1 minus alpha - significance level or probability of Type I error (false positives).

The percentage difference that we want to be able to detect: The smaller the differences we want to be able to detect, the more sample will be required. effect_size: The standardised effect size ie. If the difference between the two means divided by the standard deviation, then we will have effect size. The percentage diffrence that we want to be able to deteect must be positive.

The absolute values of the probabilities you want to detect differences on: This is a little trickier and somewhat unique to the particular test we’re working with. It turns out that, for example, detecting a difference between 50% and 51% requires a different sample size than detecting a difference between 80% and 81%. In other words, the sample size required is a function of p1, not just p1 — p2.

The distribution of the data results: Say that we want to compare proportions within sub-groups (in our case, say we want to subdivide proportion of reintegration by gender). This means that we need the sample to be big enough within each subgroup to get statistically significant comparisons. We often don’t know how the sample will plan out within each of these groups (it may be much harder to get sample for some). One option is to assume sample is distributed uniformly across subgroups.

To determine our sample size, we need to determine the minimum sample required to detect outcome variable of interest (child-outcome metrics). The main goal of UPSNP Urban Destitute Children Rehabilitation tracer study is to measure durable reintegration of Children in Street Situation (CSS) within a social context capable of surpporting and carring for them - ideally but not necessarily thier family of origin. For this tracer study - our variable of interest reintegration is defind as children who are in a stable and sustained placement, that is:

safely sheltered from elements
protected from physical and sexual abuse, exploitation for labor and other violations
physically healthy, well-nourished and clean
accessing support for psychological trauma
in or on the way to a safe and sustainable livelihood – which may
There are limited available emprical data to help us determine the initial probability (p1) for 95% confidence level. The best source of information we have is monitoring information from Government of Ethiopia Minstry of Labor and Social Affairs monitoring report and service providers who are implementing partners. We have called all service providers to ask them reintegration rate (as per the definition above) based on their experiance implementing Urban Destitute Children project and also from their previous experaince implementing similar interventions. The following table presents the reintegration results from MOLSA and service providers.
